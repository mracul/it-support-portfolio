# User Lifecycle Handling Guide (Service Desk Perspective)

This document describes **how user lifecycle requests are handled by the Service Desk**, focusing on **execution, validation, documentation, and escalation**, not policy or system design.

The purpose is to ensure lifecycle tasks are processed **consistently, safely, and traceably** within an ITSM environment.

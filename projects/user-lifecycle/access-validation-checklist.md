# Access Validation Checklist (Service Desk Use)

This checklist supports Service Desk staff in **verifying that access-related requests have been executed correctly**, safely, and in line with approvals.

It does **not** define what access users should have.

---

## Purpose of Access Validation

<!--
Explain why validation is required even when following instructions.
Hint terms:
- Human error
- Misconfiguration
- Over-provisioning
-->

---

## Pre-Execution Validation

- [ ] Request type is clearly identified (e.g. onboarding, change, offboarding)
- [ ] Required approvals are present and documented
- [ ] Scope of requested access is clear

<!--
Hint: Think "clarity before action".
-->

---

## Execution Validation

- [ ] Actions performed match the approved request
- [ ] No additional access was granted beyond request
- [ ] Changes were applied to the correct user/account

<!--
Hint terms:
- Access scope
- Change accuracy
-->

---

## Post-Execution Validation

- [ ] User access tested or confirmed where appropriate
- [ ] User or requestor notified of completion
- [ ] Any issues or limitations documented

<!--
Hint terms:
- Functional validation
- User confirmation
-->

---

## Offboarding-Specific Checks

- [ ] Account access removed or disabled as instructed
- [ ] Access to key systems verified as revoked
- [ ] Any exceptions escalated
